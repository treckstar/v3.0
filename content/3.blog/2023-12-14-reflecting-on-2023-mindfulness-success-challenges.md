## A Year of Unexpected Turns: Reflections on 2023

It's getting close to the end of the year, and I've spent the past few days reflecting on the significance of 2023. For me, it has been a year growth, both personally and professionally, highlighted by moments of success, mindfulness, and unexpected challenges.

### Mindfulness

An important reoccurring theme for me this year has been #mindfulness. I've been practicing being more present, and aware how my thoughts & actions impact both work and personal life. This journey towards mindfulness has taught me the importance of accountability â€“ not just in delivering projects or meeting deadlines, but in being accountable for my own well-being and professional development.

### Success

My passion for web development and drive to learn has been profound. I've had the opportunity to work on exciting new projects, leveraging my skills in TypeScript, Next.js, React; which have been both challenging and rewarding. Additionally I completed the requirements to become a Certified Uniform Developer @uniformdev.

### Challenges

However, the end of the year brought an unexpected turn.
Being laid off was not how I envisioned concluding 2023. This untimely event has reminded me to step back and evaluate my career path, acknowledge the skills I've gained, and plan for my next chapter. #OpenToWork

## Looking Forward

Moving forward, I want to build upon the foundation I've created in 2023. My personal goals are: eat better, get in better shape, stay drug & alcohol free, and prepare my property for market. I'm blessed and fortunate to be in my situation and don't want to take anything for granted.

## Acknowledgements

Lastly, I'd like to acknowledge and thank those who have been there for me.
To all the recruiters, your patience, persistence, and dedication to helping me with my next position.
The open source community, your contributions, insights, and collaboration have been invaluable.

## Share Your Reflections

Take some time to reflect on your 2023 and share what stands out, or some goals for the new year.
